## Video Game Sales Prediction Project

Below is a brief overview of the procedures and actions undertaken to predict results using various approaches on a dataset of video game sales. The project was part of an assessment for the Understanding Artificial Intelligence and Data Science programme.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project was obtained via Kaggle. Upon obtaining the dataset, it was discovered that there was a significant amount of missing data, with 9894 out of 16719 entries missing. This presented a considerable challenge as the dataset needed to be cleaned before any meaningful analysis could be conducted.

### Data Cleaning

Upon careful examination of the dataset, it became apparent that the missing values could not be accurately replaced using interpolation methods such as mean, median, or mode, as doing so would significantly alter the dataset's characteristics. Therefore, the most practical option was to drop all entries with missing values. The methodologies employed and the outcomes of the data-cleaning process will be elaborated upon in subsequent sections.

Please note that the dataset used for this project is not included in this repository.
